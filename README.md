# 📊 DIGISILK Research: Research on Internet Traffic and Connectivity Patterns Between China and the West

## 📌 Project Overview
This research is part of the **DIGISILK Research Initiative**, where I worked as a **Research Apprentice**. The study investigates the differences in internet traffic between Chinese and Western applications by analyzing data from Google Play Store and Tencent App Store. The study explores connectivity patterns, API dependencies, and popularity trends of applications in both regions, covering the period from 2018 to 2021.

## 🎯 Research Objectives
1. Analyze subdomain frequency and presence across application versions.
2. Compare network structures between Chinese and Western applications.
3. Examine the usage of Google APIs in Chinese applications.
4. Identify popularity trends among selected applications.

## 📊 Data Collection
- **Sources**: Google Play Store and Tencent App Store.
- **Time Period**: January 2018 - January 2021.
- **Key Consideration**: The use of **third-party app stores** in China due to Google's absence from certain smartphone ecosystems, ensuring a more **comprehensive dataset**.

## 🔬 Methodology
**Selected Applications**
- 📌 **Western Apps**: Facebook, Twitter.
- 📌 **Chinese Apps**: Zhifubao, QQ, Xiaohongshu.
- 📌 **Dual-Version Apps**: WeChat/Weixin, Taobao, TikTok/Douyin.

**Data Extraction**
- 🛠 **Python-based script** (provided by Digital Methods Specialist James Burroughs) was used to **scrape HTML data**.
- 📊 Extracted **app version codes, subdomain usage, and request frequencies** to analyze traffic behavior.

## 📑 Project Materials
### 📄 **Research Poster** ([poster.pdf](reports/poster.pdf))
- A **high-level visual summary** of the research.

### 📘 **Presentation Slides** ([presentation.pdf](reports/KURF_Presentation.pdf))
- A **detailed breakdown** of the research methodology and findings.
