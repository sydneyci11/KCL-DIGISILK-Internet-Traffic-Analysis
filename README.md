# ðŸ“Š DIGISILK Research: Research on Internet Traffic and Connectivity Patterns Between China and the West

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This research investigates the differences in internet traffic between Chinese and Western applications by analyzing data from Google Play Store and Tencent App Store. The study explores connectivity patterns, API dependencies, and popularity trends of applications in both regions, covering the period from 2018 to 2021.

## ðŸŽ¯ Research Objectives
1. Analyze subdomain frequency and presence across application versions.
2. Compare network structures between Chinese and Western applications.
3. Examine the usage of Google APIs in Chinese applications.
4. Identify popularity trends among selected applications.
